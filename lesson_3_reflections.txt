>>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-> For backing up local work
-> Collaborating with others

>>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - To take forward and work on someone's existing work. Start a new project with a particular project as foundation.

Clones - To create a copy of a git repo from remote to local, or local to local

Branches - To create a parallel code base, generally to develop an experimental feature. Many branches can exist within the same repo.
